## Jourdain et al. (2022)

Paper submitted to GRL

* NEMO-3.6 : dev\_r5151\_UKMO\_ISF branch at revision 5932 (see fortran files saved in ../Planchat\_2022/WORK)

* Very few personal customizations (see ../Planchat\_2022/MY\_SRC).

* Configuration name: AMUXL12.L75 (1/12Â°, 75 vertical levels).

* Produced by Nicolas Jourdain (IGE, Grenoble, France) on occigen (CINES) in 2020 and 2021 (HPC allocation by GENCI).

* Original simulation names: 
   - nemo\_AMUXL12\_GNJ002\_BM02MAR (1979-2009, ensemble member A)
   - nemo\_AMUXL12\_GNJ002\_BM03MAR (1979-2009, ensemble member B)
   - nemo\_AMUXL12\_GNJ002\_BM04MAR (1979-2009, ensemble member C)
